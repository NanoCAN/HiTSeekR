<p>This plot depicts the mean signal of each plate in the screen. This gives an impression of variation effects such as</p>

<ul>
	<li>Time effects: In a cell based RNAi screen, for instance, transfection efficiency decreases the longer the cells are in suspension. This means that plates seeded later (usually indicated by a high plate number) show a lower average signal.</li>
	<li>Replicate performance: Replicate plates should obviously have the same average signal. Depending on how the replicate plates have been created, this might not always be the case.</li>
	<li>Library bias: If a screening library is not randomized, the plate average might vary significantly. </li>
</ul>

<p>All these factors have to be taken into account when chosing an appropriate normalization strategy.</p>

This plot depicts the performance of controls over an entire screen. It helps to assess the robustness of the controls. For instance, there is often a trend that the performance of positive contrls is reduced over time due to cell stress. This is likely to affect all samples and points towards a loss in sensitivity. In consequence, this dictates a batch size limit. If controls did not perform as expected, this can also be seen here.

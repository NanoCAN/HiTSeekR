<p>This plot depicts the average signal per row and per column for each of the replicates. Across a large number of plates, rows and columns should have equal means. This is not always the case:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Evaporation effects: In automated cell seeding, microtiter plates suffer from evaporation where the outer wells are more affected than the inner wells. This leads to a signal bias that is reflected by a u-shape of the rows and / or columns in this plot.</li>
	<li>If individual columns or rows stand out this could be, for instance, due to a sample bias, e.g. a control column with toxic samples, or due to a bias in cell seeding or treatment. If, for example, each row in a plate is seeded through a different tube, then a single clogged tube might lead to an unexpected shift in that particular row.</li>	
</ul>

<p>If row and column bias is visible here it is advisable to consider the B-score normalization, which uses Tukey's two way median polish to address row and column bias.</p>

title: "HiTSeekR: Move and Update"
---

The HiTSeekR web application is now hosted on [ExBio](https://exbio.wzw.tum.de/hitseekr/).
From now on you can find our github repository at [biomedbigdata](https://github.com/biomedbigdata/HiTSeekR).
We updated [STITCH](http://stitch.embl.de/) to version 5.0 and use the latest [mirCancer](http://mircancer.ecu.edu/) data from October 2019.
Additionally, downloading BioAssays from PubChem via AID is available again.

title: "HiTSeekR is now integrated with SAVANAH"
---

An essential feature for the HTS community that is missing in HiTSeekR is the 
management of samples and plates in the thousands or hundreds of thousands experiments 
routinely performed in HTS facilities. However, HiTSeekR is intended for analysis and
does not keep track of uploaded data. To mitigate this, we have developed a HTS sample
management application called SAVANAH and integrated it with HiTSeekR. The mechanism
we implemented to realize this integration is still in beta status but can
in the future be used to integrate HiTSeekR with other HTS sample management solutions.  
More information about SAVANAH is available at [its project page](http://nanocan.github.io/SAVANAH/).

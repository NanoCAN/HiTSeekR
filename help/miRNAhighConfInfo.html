<p>A single miRNA can hypothetically target up to hundreds of several genes. This introduces a strong bias on conclusions drawn in downstream analysis, since many important pathways are likely to be hit through a significant number of genes just by chance. To address this issue, we assess the significance of miRNA target genes. For each potential target gene, we calculate an enrichment p-value using the hypergeometric test. In essence we test if the miRNAs targeting a particular gene are enriched with hits or not. p-values are then used to filter the target gene list after multiple testing correction. This feature is currently not available for miRNA targets obtained from the DIANA webservices.</p>

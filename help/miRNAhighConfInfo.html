<p>A single miRNA can hypothetically target up to hundreds of several genes. This introduces a strong bias on conclusions drawn in downstream analysis, since many important pathways are likely to be hit through a significant number of genes just by chance. To address this issue, we have included the high confidence microRNA targets feature. Here, it is evaluated if the observed number of miRNAs targeting each gene is by chance or if it is really a significant event. The observed p-values are then used for filtering after multiple testing. Note that The RNAhybrid database developed for hitseekr enables computation of high-confidence target genes directly via hypergeometric tests while for other databases permutation tests are needed to calculate p-values.</p>

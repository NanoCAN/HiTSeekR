<p>This is a quantile-quantile plot, which illustrates two things. First, it shows if the bulk of the data follows a normal distribution as you would expect in a primary screen without any general bias. Secondly, it gives an impression of the number of hits (samples deviating from the line at both ends) and of how well they are separated from the bulk of the data, e.g. strong or weak curvature. This plot thus provides a strong indication on whether or not to use a plate-based normalization method, where the assumption is that the majority of samples are inactive.</p>

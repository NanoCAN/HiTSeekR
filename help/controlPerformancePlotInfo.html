To allow for a robust detection of moderate hits in a high-throughput screen it is imperative to be able to clearly separate positive and negative controls in a screen. The reasoning is that positive controls are usually chosen to exhibit a strong effect and consequently should be easy to identify. The strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD) suggested by Zhang et al. is a recognized statistical measure to assess how well to groups of replicates can be separated. An SSMD of 3 or higher (orange area) indicates good separability, while an SSMD of 6 or higher (white area) indicates excellent separability. An SSMD < 3 (red area) indicates that it might be difficult to identify moderate hits reliably in a given screen or its subset.

To allow for a robust detection of moderate hits in a high-throughput screen it is imperative to be able to clearly separate positive and negative controls in a screen. The reasoning is that positive controls are usually chosen to exhibit a strong effect and consequently should be easy to identify. 
<br>The Z-factor/Z' suggested by Zhang et al. is a recognized statistical measure to assess how well to groups of replicates can be separated. A Z-factor of 0.5 or higher (white area) indicates good separability. Z-factors between 0 and 0.5 (orange area) are considered marginal. There is no sufficient separability for Z-factors below 0 (red area). Note that Z-factors below -0.5 are not shown.
<br> While the Z factor is widely used in the field, we recommend using SSMD instead due to its clear probabilistic interpretation <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2006.12.014">(https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2006.12.014)</a>.

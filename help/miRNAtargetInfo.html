<p>Here, a number of miRNA target databases can be queried for genes targeted by the identified hits. We have included experimental databases like tarbase and mirtarbase, but since they provide only limited information various predictive databases have been added. The databases prefixed DIANA are queried via a webservice and have a longer response time.</p>

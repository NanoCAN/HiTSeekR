<p>This is a heatmap depicting the entire screen. Hits are denoted by little black arrows. The purpose of this screen is to see if hits are accumulating in a non-random fashion. This could point to a systematic bias in the data, e.g. when most hits are found on a few plates or a unusually high number of hits is placed on a particular row or column. If this is the case check if the screening library has been properly randomized, otherwise change the data processing strategy.</p>
